# PHP Login System

This is a simple PHP-based login system with user authentication, including login, signup, logout, and a welcome page. It uses MySQL as the database and password hashing for security.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- PHP (>=7.4 recommended)
- MySQL (MariaDB)
- XAMPP / LAMP / WAMP stack (local development server)
- HTML (for frontend forms)

---

├── logout.php           # Destroys session and logs out user
└── README.md            # Project instructions
```

## ⚙️ Requirements

- PHP server (XAMPP/LAMP/WAMP recommended)
- MySQL Database
- Web browser

---

## 🛠️ Installation Steps

1. **Install XAMPP (or your preferred PHP server):**
   - Download from: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
   - Install and start Apache and MySQL modules from the XAMPP control panel.

2. **Create the Database:**

   Open phpMyAdmin (usually at http://localhost/phpmyadmin) and run the following SQL:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE login_db;

   USE login_db;

   CREATE TABLE users (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
       password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

3. **Copy Project Files:**

   - Unzip the downloaded folder.
   - Paste the folder (e.g., `php_login_system`) into `C:/xampp/htdocs/` (Windows) or `/var/www/html/` (Linux).

4. **Run in Browser:**

   Go to:
   ```
   http://localhost/php_login_system/login.php
   ```

5. **Register a New User:**

   - Click on "Sign up here" to register.
   - After successful signup, log in with the same credentials.

6. **Logout:**

   - Click "Logout" on the welcome page to end the session.

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed using PHP’s `password_hash()` and verified with `password_verify()`.
- SQL queries use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.

---

## 🚀 Optional Improvements

- Add email verification
- Use PDO instead of MySQLi
- Enable HTTPS
- Client-side validation (JavaScript)

---

Enjoy building with PHP! 😎
